    "paragraph": "Wand is a tool designed to help everyone bring their ideas to life-and in the process, make us all a bit more divine. We feel that in order to truly represent and explore our ideas accurately with Al, we need tools that give us greater personalization and hands- on, visual control over the generative models we use. We're building a collaborative, native tool with these principles in mind-so that we can help artists and design teams explore and spark new ideas. We're an NYC based team of creatives and engineers passionate about artistic expression and generative Al. We recently raised a seed round led by OSV (partnering with Jim O'Shaughnessy, the executive chairman of Stability.ai) along with a number of other great firms, and we're looking to expand the team!"
